    physical bilayer thickness (MIN..MAX nm) away. The partner is validated by its
    height above the shared solvent baseline (``b.min()``), not by ``find_peaks``
    prominence. This matters for two reasons:

    * A merged/thin bilayer (e.g. an OMM at this resolution) has two real leaflets
      separated by a near-flat saddle, so the shorter leaflet's *prominence* is tiny
      and any prominence floor -- or comparing the two leaflets' prominences -- drops
      it. Height above the common base is independent of saddle depth, so both
      leaflets of a merged bilayer are kept.
    * Comparing height-above-base still rejects small flanking shoulders (neighbouring
      protein density), which sit well below ``MIN_LEAFLET_HEIGHT_RATIO`` of the
      membrane peak, and the MIN..MAX window rejects distant confounders.

    Being permissive here is safe: the caller validates every dual fit by R^2 and
    fitted thickness, so a spurious partner is discarded downstream, whereas a missed
    leaflet would wrongly skip the dual fit entirely. ``n_resolved`` is the number of

    Fit gaussian(s) to density profiles and return center offsets and sigmas.

    Two modes available (controlled by _worker_use_xcorr):

    Cross-correlation mode (_worker_use_xcorr=True):
        Uses normalized cross-correlation with reference profile to find
        optimal shift. Very robust to noise and shape variations.

    Gaussian fitting mode (_worker_use_xcorr=False):
        Uses adaptive model selection:
        1. Try dual Gaussian (bilayer model)
        2. If R² > 0.6 and thickness in 2-7 nm range, use it
        3. Otherwise try single Gaussian
