### Quantification of Membrane Surfaces Segmented from Cryo-ET or other volumetric imaging.
Author: __Benjamin Barad__/*<benjamin.barad@gmail.com>*, developed in close collaboration with Michaela Medina.

A pipeline of tools to generate robust open-mesh surfaces from voxel segmentations of biological membranes
using the Screened Poisson algorithm, calculate morphological features including curvature and membrane–membrane
distance using pycurv's vector-voting framework, and convert these morphological quantities into morphometric insights.

Everything is driven by a single `morphometrics` command plus a `config.yml` file.

## Installation

### Option 1: Conda (recommended)
The fastest, easiest starting point for most Linux boxes, and now for Mac as well.
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/grotjahnlab/surface_morphometrics.git`
2. Create the environment (this also installs the toolkit and the `morphometrics` command via `pip install -e .`): `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate it: `conda activate morphometrics`
4. Check the install: `morphometrics --help` should list the pipeline subcommands.

> Older Ubuntu installs (and some other Linux distributions) have known issues with graph-tool. If the main environment file fails, try `conda env create -f environment-ubuntu.yml` instead (tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).

> If you pull updates into an existing clone and the `morphometrics` command seems out of date, re-run `pip install -e .` from the repo root inside the activated environment.

### Option 2: Docker
Useful on Windows and other systems where graph-tool or pymeshlab do not play nicely with conda. The image ships with all dependencies pre-installed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grotjahnlab/surface_morphometrics.git
cd surface_morphometrics/docker
./sm-up.sh      # build/pull, start, and enter the container
# ... run morphometrics commands inside the container ...
exit            # leave the container
./sm-down.sh    # stop the container
```
Start a later session the same way (`cd surface_morphometrics/docker && ./sm-up.sh`); end it with `exit` then `./sm-down.sh`.

### Shell completion (optional)
`morphometrics` is a [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) command, so tab-completion of subcommands and options is available. Add the matching line to your shell startup file:
```bash
# ~/.bashrc  (bash >= 4.4)
eval "$(_MORPHOMETRICS_COMPLETE=bash_source morphometrics)"
# ~/.zshrc
eval "$(_MORPHOMETRICS_COMPLETE=zsh_source morphometrics)"
# ~/.config/fish/completions/morphometrics.fish
_MORPHOMETRICS_COMPLETE=fish_source morphometrics | source
```
For faster shell startup, write the script to a file once (`_MORPHOMETRICS_COMPLETE=zsh_source morphometrics > ~/.morphometrics-complete.zsh`) and `source` that. (macOS ships an old bash 3.2 — use zsh, the macOS default, or install a newer bash.)

---

## Quick start
Once installed, the fastest way to see the whole pipeline run is on the bundled example (a small cropped tomogram + segmentation, ~44 MB, downloaded from Zenodo):
```bash
morphometrics fetch_example          # downloads + extracts surface_morphometrics_example/
cd surface_morphometrics_example     # has tomograms/, segmentations/, and a ready config.yml

morphometrics make_meshes config.yml                 # 1. segmentations -> surface meshes
morphometrics pycurv config.yml                      # 2. curvature
morphometrics distances_orientations config.yml      # 3. distances & orientations
morphometrics sample_density config.yml              # 4. sample tomogram density (for thickness)
morphometrics measure_thickness config.yml           # 5. membrane thickness
```
Each command prints what to run next. See [The pipeline](#the-pipeline) for what every step does and how to configure it for your own data.

---

## Example data
Tutorial **segmentations** live in `example_data/`:
```bash
cd example_data
tar -xzvf examples.tar.gz   # -> TE1.mrc, TF1.mrc
```
`TE1.mrc` and `TF1.mrc` are segmentation label volumes — enough to run the curvature and distance/orientation steps. No raw tomograms are included here (they are large), so thickness and refinement need the full-pipeline example below. You can inspect them with `mrcfile`:
```python
import mrcfile
with mrcfile.open('TE1.mrc', permissive=True) as mrc:
    print(mrc.data.shape)  # (312, 928, 960)
```
> Some MRC headers are non-standard (e.g. exported from Amira); open them with `permissive=True` and ignore the "file may be corrupt" warning — the toolkit still runs correctly.

**Full-pipeline example (with a raw tomogram).** To exercise `sample_density`, `measure_thickness`, and `refine_mesh`, use `morphometrics fetch_example` (see [Quick start](#quick-start)). The bundle is a cropped IMM+OMM sub-volume with a preconfigured `config.yml` (IMM=1, OMM=2). The full uncropped tomograms are on [EMPIAR-12534](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-12534/); `morphometrics fetch_example --source empiar` prints how to retrieve them (hundreds of MB to GB each).

---

## The pipeline
Each step reads a `config.yml` and writes its outputs into the configured `work_dir`. Steps run in order; each command prints a hint for the next one. On a 4-core laptop the tutorial datasets take a few hours end to end (the pycurv and, if used, refinement steps dominate); cluster parallelization brings this down substantially.

| # | Step | Command |
|---|------|---------|
| 0 | Create a config | `morphometrics new_config` |
| 1 | Segmentations → meshes | `morphometrics make_meshes config.yml` |
| 2 | Curvature (pycurv) | `morphometrics pycurv config.yml` |
| 3 | *(optional)* [Mesh refinement](#mesh-refinement-optional) | `morphometrics refine_mesh config.yml` → `accept_refinement` |
| 4 | Distances & orientations | `morphometrics distances_orientations config.yml` |
| 5 | [Thickness](#data-organization-for-thickness-and-refinement) (needs tomograms) | `morphometrics sample_density config.yml` → `measure_thickness` |
| 6 | Aggregate statistics | `morphometrics stats config.yml <name>` |

Most steps also accept a single input (e.g. `morphometrics pycurv config.yml TE1_OMM.surface.vtp`, `morphometrics distances_orientations config.yml TE1.mrc`) so you can parallelize per tomogram on a cluster.

### Configuration
`morphometrics new_config` writes a fully-commented `config.yml` into the current directory (`-o NAME` for a different name); edit it for your project. A few starting tips:
- For higher-quality meshes with near-equilateral triangles, set `isotropic_remesh: true` and `simplify: false` in `surface_generation`. `target_area` of 1.0–3.0 nm² works well (smaller = finer but slower).
- Set the directories and labels: `seg_dir`, `tomo_dir`, `work_dir`, and `segmentation_values` (the label value → name mapping for your segmentation).

### Data organization for thickness and refinement
Thickness (step 5) and refinement (step 3) read the **raw tomogram** density, not just the segmentation. Three directories in `config.yml` control this:
- `seg_dir` — the segmentation MRC files (label volumes you generate surfaces from).
- `tomo_dir` — the **raw (greyscale) tomogram** MRC files the segmentations were drawn on.
- `work_dir` — the working/output directory where pycurv writes its graphs (`.gt`) and CSVs.

**Each raw tomogram in `tomo_dir` must share the basename (the part before `.mrc`) of its segmentation.** Tomograms are matched to surfaces by globbing `work_dir` for `{tomogram_basename}*{component}.AVV_rh{radius_hit}.gt`. For example, segmentation `TE1.mrc` (producing `TE1_OMM.AVV_rh9.gt`) needs a raw tomogram also named `TE1.mrc`. A typical layout:
```
project/
├── segmentations/   # seg_dir  ->  TE1.mrc, TF1.mrc   (label volumes)
├── tomograms/       # tomo_dir ->  TE1.mrc, TF1.mrc   (raw density, matching basenames)
└── morphometrics/   # work_dir ->  TE1_OMM.AVV_rh9.gt, ... (pycurv output + results)
```
A basename mismatch is the most common reason thickness or refinement "finds no files" (the tomogram is silently skipped).

### Mesh refinement (optional)
After pycurv and *before* the distance/thickness steps, `morphometrics refine_mesh config.yml` nudges surface vertices onto the true membrane bilayer center. It samples the raw tomogram density along surface normals and iteratively recenters vertices on the fitted bilayer (or, for high-defocus data, a single Gaussian), re-running pycurv each iteration. It needs raw tomograms organized as in [Data organization](#data-organization-for-thickness-and-refinement), and is tuned via the `mesh_refinement` section of `config.yml`.

Refinement **improves every surface**, so it is worth running — but it is **by far the slowest step** (it runs pycurv internally on each Gaussian-fitting iteration, ≈ several `morphometrics pycurv` runs per surface). For large datasets, process one surface at a time (`--tomogram`/`--mrc`) in parallel on a cluster, or set aside time for the full run.

Refinement does **not** replace your working surfaces automatically. It writes a numbered surface per iteration (`*_refined_iter*.surface.vtp`) plus convergence plots (`*_refinement_convergence.png`, `*_profile_evolution.png`). Inspect those, then commit the best iteration:
```bash
morphometrics accept_refinement config.yml <step>      # <step> = iteration number
```
This backs the originals up to `*.orig.bak`, promotes the chosen iteration to the canonical surface (`*.surface.vtp` and `*.AVV_rh*.gt/.vtp/.csv`), and removes the other iterations and intermediates while keeping the summaries. Options: `--dry-run` previews all changes; `--component_name OMM` / `--tomogram TF1` restrict to a subset.

> When `use_xcorr` is enabled, intermediate cross-correlation iterations are saved with a fast "lightweight" graph (no curvature) — only the final iteration runs full pycurv. If you accept a lightweight iteration, the promoted surface has **no `*.AVV_rh*.gt` graph** and needs pycurv re-run first; `accept_refinement` warns you and prints the exact command.

---

## Analysis & visualization
After the pipeline, per-triangle quantifications live in the `.gt` graphs, `.vtp` surfaces, and `.csv` tables in `work_dir`.

### Statistics & plotting
The `stats` command (step 6) assembles an Experiment pickle across all tomograms in your data folder; from there, analysis is done in pandas (the `Experiment`/`Tomogram` classes and helpers in `surface_morphometrics.morphometrics_stats`). Quick single-file plots:
- `morphometrics histogram filename.csv -n feature` — area-weighted histogram of one feature.
- `morphometrics hist2d filename.csv -n1 feature1 -n2 feature2` — area-weighted 2D histogram of two features.

Paper-specific analyses (e.g. `old_scripts/mitochondria_statistics.py`, which generated every plot/statistic in the preprint) live in `old_scripts/` and are run directly with `python` from the repo root.

### Protein patch and connected-component analysis (optional)
These tools tag regions of a membrane graph with an integer id so per-region statistics (curvature, thickness, etc.) can be computed and compared. They share the `patch_analysis` section of `config.yml`. Both patch and component tools write `*_patches.{gt,vtp,csv}` / `*_components.{gt,vtp,csv}`, so every per-triangle property is available for pandas.

**Protein-centered patches** — `morphometrics generate_patches`. Given a STAR file of particle coordinates (ATP synthase, ribosomes, …) and a membrane graph, places a circular patch (`patch_radius` nm) on the nearest membrane triangle to each particle:
```bash
morphometrics generate_patches config.yml                                    # batch over all tomograms
morphometrics generate_patches config.yml --graph TS1_IMM.AVV_rh9.gt --star TS1.star
morphometrics generate_patches config.yml --no-random                       # skip random control patches
```
- Each patch is identified by the particle's **STAR line ID** (`patch_number`/`patch_center`).
- Triangles in overlapping patches go to the **nearest** center; the deciding distances are stored as `patch_center_distance` and `protein_distance`.
- With `generate_random: true`, matched **random control patches** are placed (`random_min_distance`, reproducible via `random_seed`) as `patch_random_number`/`patch_random_center`, reusing ids so `patch_random_number == i` controls for `patch_number == i`.
- `particle_max_distance` skips particles too far from the membrane (`null` disables).
- **Batch STAR matching:** STAR files live in `star_dir`, matched per tomogram via `star_pattern` (default `"{tomo}.star"`); coordinate/pixel-size columns are configurable and default to RELION conventions.
- **Which particles are used:** by default *every* row in the STAR is used, so each STAR must hold only that tomogram's particles. For a **combined multi-tomogram STAR**, set `star_tomo_column` (e.g. `rlnMicrographName`); rows are matched to the tomogram by **basename** (tolerating paths, `.mrc` extensions, and different pixel-size/bin names like `/data/TS_004.mrc_6.65Apx.mrc`). `patch_id` stays tied to the original STAR row. Single-graph mode: `--star-tomo-column`/`--tomo-name`.
- **Annotated STAR output:** with `annotate_star: true`, writes `{star}_{label}_meshannotated.star` adding `patch_id`, `mesh_distance`, and `mesh_neighbor_id` per particle — useful for particle-side filtering (e.g. selecting cotranslating ribosomes by `mesh_distance`).

**Connected components** — `morphometrics label_components`. Labels each connected component with `component_number` (1..N by size; `min_component_size` drops small ones). Parallels `patch_number`, so the same per-region math applies:
```bash
morphometrics label_components config.yml                  # all AVV graphs
morphometrics label_components config.yml --graph TS1_IMM.AVV_rh9.gt
```

**Per-region statistics** — `morphometrics patch_statistics`. One property-agnostic, area-weighted aggregator for patches *and* components; reads the per-triangle CSVs and writes one tidy `patch_statistics.csv` (one row per region):
```bash
morphometrics patch_statistics config.yml                              # all *_patches.csv in work_dir
morphometrics patch_statistics config.yml --pattern "*_components.csv" # components instead
morphometrics patch_statistics config.yml --properties curvedness_VV,thickness --csv TS1_IMM.AVV_rh9_patches.csv
```
Auto-detects whichever label columns are present (`patch_number`, `patch_random_number`, `component_number`) and tags each row with `region_type` (`patch`/`random`/`component`) so real patches and controls land in one table. Reports area-weighted mean and median per property (`statistics_properties`), plus `n_triangles` and `total_area`. Zero/NaN values are dropped per property (`--keep-zeros` to keep); region id 0 is always excluded.

**Arbitrary region extractor** — `morphometrics extract_patches`. Splits a graph into independent `.gt/.vtp/.csv` subsets by a label column or by thresholding any vertex property:
```bash
morphometrics extract_patches config.yml --graph TS1_IMM.AVV_rh9_patches.gt --by patch_number    # one file per patch
morphometrics extract_patches config.yml --graph TS1_ER.AVV_rh9.gt --property OMM_dist --max 30   # ER within 30 nm of OMM
```

> This workflow is ported from [GrotjahnLab/patch_analysis](https://github.com/GrotjahnLab/patch_analysis). Still to come: the flipper-based line-scan sampling.

### Exporting surfaces for Blender / visualization
`morphometrics export_obj` converts a quantified surface `.vtp` into a Wavefront **OBJ + MTL** with one quantification baked into the surface color — ready for Blender, MeshLab, etc.
```bash
morphometrics export_obj config.yml TS1_IMM.AVV_rh9.vtp --list-features          # see colorable arrays
morphometrics export_obj config.yml TS1_IMM.AVV_rh9.vtp --feature curvedness_VV  # one surface
morphometrics export_obj config.yml --feature thickness --cmap magma             # batch over work_dir
```
- Writes `<base>_<feature>.obj`, `.mtl`, and `.png` (the colormap image referenced via `map_Kd`).
- Each triangle is flat-colored by its value via per-face UVs that sample a 1D colormap strip, so per-triangle values are preserved exactly.
- Range defaults to the 2nd–98th percentile (`--vmin/--vmax`), any matplotlib `--cmap`; works on any per-triangle (or per-vertex, averaged) array.
- NaN/unmeasured triangles get a distinct swatch (`--nan-color`, default `lightgrey`; `--nan-color none` maps them to the low end instead).
- In Blender, import the OBJ (MTL/PNG are picked up automatically) and switch to Material Preview/Rendered shading.

## Reference

### Package layout and lower-level modules
The toolkit is the `surface_morphometrics` Python package; the pipeline steps are `morphometrics` subcommands, but the underlying modules can also be imported or run with `python -m surface_morphometrics.<module>`:
- **Mesh generation** (`make_meshes`): `mrc2xyz` (segmentation → point cloud), `xyz2ply` (screened-Poisson reconstruction + masking), `ply2vtp` (ply → vtp for pycurv).
- **Morphology extraction**: `curvature` (pycurv, via `pycurv`), `refine_mesh` / `accept_refinement`, `intradistance_verticality` and `interdistance_orientation` (wrapped by `distances_orientations`), `sample_density` + `measure_thickness`.
- **Quantification**: `morphometrics_stats` (pandas classes/helpers; `stats` assembles the Experiment pickle), plus [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) for 3D surface mapping. See the **[Quantifications Documentation](quantifications_documentation.md)**.

### File types
- `.xyz` — point clouds (flat text `X Y Z` per line), nm or Å scale.
- `.ply` — surface meshes (binary), nm or Å scale; open in [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/) and many tools.
- `.surface.vtp` — the same meshes in [VTK](https://vtk.org/) format; the input pycurv reads to build graphs. Open in [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) / [pyvista](https://docs.pyvista.org/).
- `.AVV_rh*.vtp` — pycurv outputs carrying the quantifications; richest for Paraview/pyvista visualization.
- `.gt` — triangle graphs (`graph-tool`); fast neighbor operations, not for manual inspection.
- `.csv` — per-triangle quantification tables; the files you use for statistics and plots.
- `.log` — logs, mostly from pycurv.
- Quantification outputs (plots/tests) are written as csv, svg, and png.

---

## Troubleshooting
- `Gaussian or Mean curvature of X has a large computation error` — safe to ignore (pycurv cleans these up); they are suppressed by default.
- MRC files from AMIRA (and some other software, e.g. Dragonfly) lack proper machine stamps; open with `mrcfile.open(filename, permissive=True)`.
- If pycurv seems to hang indefinitely, try setting `cores: 1` in the config.

---

## Upgrading from older versions
The toolkit is now an installable package driven by the single `morphometrics` command (installed by `conda env create`, or `pip install -e .` inside the env). The old `python <script>.py …` invocations still work for now via deprecation shims that warn and forward to the new command; they will be removed in a future release.

Two config keys were also renamed: `data_dir` → `seg_dir`, and `max_triangles` → `simplify_max_triangles` (used only when `simplify: true`). `make_meshes` warns if it detects the old names.

| Old | New |

| `python segmentation_to_meshes.py config.yml` | `morphometrics make_meshes config.yml` |
| `python run_pycurv.py config.yml f.surface.vtp` | `morphometrics pycurv config.yml f.surface.vtp` |
| `python measure_distances_orientations.py config.yml f.mrc` | `morphometrics distances_orientations config.yml f.mrc` |
| `python sample_density.py config.yml` | `morphometrics sample_density config.yml` |

| `python refine_mesh.py config.yml` | `morphometrics refine_mesh config.yml` |
| `python accept_refinement.py config.yml N` | `morphometrics accept_refinement config.yml N` |
| `python morphometrics_stats.py config.yml name` | `morphometrics stats config.yml name` |
| `python single_file_histogram.py f.csv -n feat` | `morphometrics histogram f.csv -n feat` |
| `python single_file_2d.py f.csv -n1 a -n2 b` | `morphometrics hist2d f.csv -n1 a -n2 b` |
| *(new)* | `morphometrics new_config` — write a starter `config.yml` |
