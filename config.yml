#SEGMENTATION TO MESH 
surface_generation:
  angstroms: false # Default scaling adjusts so surfaces are nm-scaled, if set to true surfaces are not rescaled and remain angstrom-scaled.
  ultrafine: false # Not necessary under normal conditions but may help with unusually challenging membranes. Uses additional subdivision and resampling before cropping.
  extrapolation_distance: 1.5 # Distance in nm (or angstroms, if angstrom setting is True) to extrapolate the surface
  isotropic_remesh: true # If true, applies isotropic remeshing to create near-equilateral triangles with target average area.
  target_area: 1.0 # Target average triangle area in square units (nm^2 by default). Used when isotropic_remesh is true.
  simplify: false # If true, decimates the mesh to max_triangles. Note: simplified surfaces will not be isotropic.
  max_triangles: 300000 # Only used if simplify is true. When using isotropic_remesh, target_area controls triangle count instead.
  octree_depth: 9 # Increase if the surface is too smooth, decrease if surface is too jagged - but has a HUGE effect.
  point_weight: 0.7 # Larger numbers have stronger weight towards fitting segmented points, smaller numbers have stronger weight towards generating a smooth surface
  neighbor_count: 400 # Number of neighbors used for normal estimation. Should not need to adjust this, but I am exposing it as a tuning variable. Values over 50 seem to all be equivalently good...

  smoothing_iterations: 1 # Number of smoothing iterations to perform for estimating normals. You should usually leave this at 1.

curvature_measurements:
  radius_hit: 9 # This corresponds to the radius of the smallest feature of interest, roughly, for neighborhood determination. 8-15 seems to be a good range for mitochondria
  min_component: 30 # The minimum number of triangles for a component to be considered for curvature measurement.
  exclude_borders: 1 # Values greater than zero exclude the border from the curvature calculation by n nm/angstroms.
distance_and_orientation_measurements:
  mindist: 3 # Minimum distance between two points for them to be considered for distance measurement.
